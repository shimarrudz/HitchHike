# HitchHike - Smart Mobility Platform :blue_car:
We were challenged by Stellantis, through FIAP, to develop a solution focused on "smart mobility" in order to have a positive impact on mobility in general. As a result, we created the "HitchHike" platform, which is a carpooling platform aimed at fostering solidarity.

## Introduction :rocket:
HitchHike is a web-based platform that connects drivers and passengers who are traveling in the same direction. It encourages carpooling and facilitates the sharing of rides, thereby reducing traffic congestion, lowering carbon emissions, and promoting social interaction among users.

## Key Features :key:
Ride Sharing :car: Users can offer or request rides, specifying their origin, destination, and preferred time of travel. The platform matches drivers with passengers based on their route and schedule, optimizing the carpooling experience.

User Profiles :busts_in_silhouette: Each user has a profile that includes their name, photo, ratings, and reviews from previous rides. This helps build trust and ensures a safe and reliable carpooling community.

Booking and Payment :money_with_wings: The platform allows passengers to book a seat in a carpool and provides a seamless payment process, ensuring a fair distribution of travel expenses among users.

Real-time Tracking :round_pushpin: Users can track the location of their ride in real-time, enhancing safety and providing peace of mind during the journey.

Notifications and Messaging :bell: The platform sends notifications and allows users to communicate with each other through secure messaging, making it easy to coordinate pick-up points and stay connected throughout the ride.

## Benefits :green_heart:
Reduced Traffic :traffic_light: By encouraging carpooling, HitchHike helps reduce the number of vehicles on the road, easing traffic congestion and improving overall transportation efficiency.

Environmental Impact :earth_americas: Sharing rides significantly reduces carbon emissions and contributes to a greener and more sustainable environment.

Cost Savings :moneybag: Users can save money by sharing travel expenses, as the cost of fuel and tolls is divided among passengers.

Social Interaction :handshake: HitchHike promotes social interaction by connecting people with similar travel routes, fostering new friendships, and creating a sense of community.

## Future Enhancements :bulb:
We are committed to continuously improving the HitchHike platform and expanding its features. Some potential enhancements for the future include:

Integration with Public Transportation :train: Integrating the platform with public transportation systems to provide seamless multi-modal travel options.

Advanced Matching Algorithm :chart_with_upwards_trend: Developing an advanced algorithm to optimize ride matching based on user preferences, traffic patterns, and other variables.

Safety Features :shield: Implementing additional safety features such as background checks, emergency assistance, and driver/passenger verification.

Community Feedback :speech_balloon: Incorporating a feedback system where users can rate and provide reviews to further enhance trust and accountability within the community.

## Get Involved :raised_hands:
We invite you to join the HitchHike community and be a part of the smart mobility revolution. Together, we can make a positive impact on the way we commute and contribute to a more sustainable future.
